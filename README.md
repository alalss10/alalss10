Hello and welcome to my profile!

I'm Alfian Bagus Ramadhani, but you can call me Fin, my nickname, or **AKA** as **Monk** on internet platforms.

I am a high school student with a passion for programming and pixel art. I am currently learning coding and creating pixel art for a plugin project of one of the biggest games for community-based extension content.

In the future, I hope to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.

Check out my pixel art creations on Instagram at ig: [@d_monk10](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDQ0MTY5NTA1ODU1ODA5?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ). However, I am more active on Discord.
